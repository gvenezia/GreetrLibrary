# GreetrLibrary

A small JS library with methods for different types of greetings.

Users can create an object with a firstName, lastName, and lang(uage).

'greet()' creates an informal greeting string. With an argument, like 'greet(true)', it creates a formal greeting.

Uses jQuery to output to html.
